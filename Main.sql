Agenda

01. Retrieve the top 10 countries with the highest and lowest average happiness scores over the years 2018 to 2022.
02. Compare the average healthy life expectancy for countries in the top 20% of happiness scores versus countries in the bottom 20%.
03. Calculate the average happiness score for each region or continent and rank them from highest to lowest in 2021.
04. Which countries showed the most significant improvement or decline in their overall happiness rank between 2018 and 2022?
05. Is there a correlation between a country's GDP per capita and its happiness score? If so, how strong is the correlation?
06. Which factors (out of all) have the strongest correlation with the overall happiness score?
07. Find the correlation between social support and happiness scores across all years.
08. Determine the percentage of countries where the freedom to make life choices improved from 2018 to 2022.
09. Are there any surprising or unexpected outliers in the database? Analyze the reasons behind their exceptionally high or low happiness scores?
10. Create a composite index that combines multiple factors (such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, etc.) to measure overall happiness? How does this composite index compare to the original happiness scores?

|------------------------------COMPARISION------------------------------|

The top 20% countries predominantly consist of developed nations from regions such as Europe, East Asia, Australia.
In contrast, the bottom 20% countries are mainly from regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia with relatively poor or crippling economies.
This suggests that regional factors and development levels play a significant role in determining HLE.

Comparing the averages:
The average HLE of the top 20% countries is approximately 73.712.
The average HLE of the bottom 20% countries is approximately 55.907, which is approx. 75.89% of that of the top 20% countries.

Regions like North America and ANZ (Australia and New Zealand) and Western Europe have higher average happiness scores, suggesting a generally higher level of happiness in these regions compared to others.

Sub-Saharan Africa has the 2nd lowest average happiness score among all the regions listed. This indicates that, on average, the countries in this region face greater challenges and lower levels of subjective well-being.

While Latin America and the Caribbean have a relatively lower average happiness score compared to regions like North America and Western Europe, it still ranks higher than some other regions, indicating a moderate level of happiness in the region.
